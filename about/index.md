Hi! I'm a software architect and senior full stack developer with more than 10 year experience. I have in depth expertise in web development, creating fast API's and Single Page Application interfaces. I am working for several years in startup environment so I am used to be involved in every piece of the infrastructure.

I went through several programming languages in my experience: Java, Ruby, Elixir. Latest I specialized in Elixir on server side and React on client side. They offer the best mix for me between: productivity, fun writing code, readability, performance, scalability.

I am also a big fan of software architecture and testing. In my opinion a resilient and fast application requires a good architecture and a well tested code. I use Test Driven Development for all the code that I write.
