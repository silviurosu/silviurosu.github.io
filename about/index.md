Hi! I'm Silviu Rosu - software architect and senior developer. I have in depth expertise in web development, creating fast API's and SPA interfaces. I am working for several years in startup environment so I am used to be involved in every piece of the infrastructure.

I went through several programming languages in my experience: Java, Ruby, Elixir. Latest I specialized in Elixir on server side and React on client side. I think they offer the best mix of productivity, fun writing code and top features and speed in production.

I am a big fan of architecture and testing. I think it's the only way to build resilient applications.

If you need my help in creating a good quality software infrastructure for your startup or need technical advise please write me at silviu.rosu@gmail.com.
