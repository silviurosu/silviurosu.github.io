When I found out with statement in Elixir I was amazed of how much it simplifies the code and how readable it becomes. I used it extensively in my code. With time I encountered some downsides that I will try to explain here.

Basically the with statement saves you of having nested if statements that can become a nightmare if there are more than 2. Business logic that does not fulfill the first statement should not be continued further. One example where it is handy:

```elixir
with {:ok, order} <- load_order_from_database()6,
     {:ok, true} <- validate_delivery_address(order),
     {:ok, true} <- validate_delivery_address(order),
```
